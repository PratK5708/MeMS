This C code initializes a simple memory management system (MeMS) using mmap for page-sized allocations. It allocates and manages memory blocks using a free list. The main steps include:

Initialization: MeMS is initialized with a free block representing the entire allocated memory page.
Memory Allocation: It allocates 10 arrays of 250 integers each using mems_malloc, displaying their virtual addresses.
Memory Access: It demonstrates that MeMS allows access to elements using mems_get, writing to one element and reading it through another.
Printing Stats: The system's statistics are printed, showing the main chain, unused space, and sub-chain lengths.
Memory Free: It frees memory at a specific index and reallocates it, affecting the free list.
Unmapping: The allocated memory is unmapped using mems_finish.
